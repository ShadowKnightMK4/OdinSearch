BETA BETA BETA.

This format is subject to change. Releases will have a set in stone version.   Corrent version is zero.

PluginInit(DWORD Version) <- called on loading your plugin. will contain the highest version it supports.
                          <- your plugin should return true if supported and false if not.


SetCustomArg(wchar_t* name, LPVOID arg) <- called to set a value to the argument for your plugin
                                        <- you should save the value if you need to preserve it (unicode string,ect..)
                                        <- although this is LPVOID  a pointer - it's likely gonna be a unicode string.


The rest off the routines are named identical to the same routines in OdinSearch_OutputConsumerBase C# class.
Your plugin is handled via OdinSearch_OutputConsumer_ExternUnmangedPlugin that takes care of loading it and 
exposing the routines via a C# layer to the rest of OdinSearch. Your unmanaged DLL is responsible for any needed allocation and freeing memory.


When OdinSearch_OutputConsumer_ExternUnmangedPlugin is disposed, your plugin has the routine to unload dlls called aka FreeLibrary.


There are a few differences. All strings passed are UNICODE strings.
